**Enhanced Ambient Mode for YouTube**  
youtube-better-ambient is a browser extension that enhances YouTubeâ€™s ambient mode by placing a blurred version of the video in the background and making various UI elements transparent for a more immersive experience.

## Possible Features (Planned / Ideas)
- Add settings to control blur intensity, opacity, and toggle the extension on/off
- ~~Publish extension on Chrome and Firefox extension stores~~ (Chrome Store requires a refresh token, it is not possible to automate that)
- ~~Use GitHub Actions for automated builds~~
- Render blur using OpenGL with linear Gaussian blur (via multiple box blurs)
- ~~Automatically disable blur in fullscreen mode to reduce resource usage~~
